\chapter{Direct current resistivity with steel-cased wells}
\label{ch:casing_dc}


\section{Introduction}
Subsurface resistivity can be a valuable part of a geologic interpretation, whether that be identifying lithologic units, characterizing changes within a reservoir, or imaging subsurface injections associated with carbon capture and storage or hydraulic fracturing. In many of these settings, steel-cased wellbores are present. Steel has a significant conductivity, which is generally six or more orders of magnitude larger that of the surrounding of the geologic formation. Clearly, such a large contrast is important to consider when conducting a DC resistivity survey. On one-hand, the role of the steel casing may be viewed as ``distortion'' which complicates the signals of interest \citep{Wait1983, Holladay1984, Johnston1987}. In other scenarios, a wellbore may be beneficial in that it can serve as an ``extended electrode'' so that current-injection and sampling of the resultant electrical potentials can take place beneath near surface heterogeneities \citep{Ramirez1996, Rucker2010, Rucker2012} or so that currents injected at the surface can reach significant depths \citep{Schenkel1994, Weiss2016, hoversten2017borehole}. There has also been a rise in interest in examining the use of electrical or electromagnetic methods deployed on the surface to look for flaws or breaks in the casing \citep{Wilt2018}.

To build a physical understanding of electrical and electromagnetic methods in settings where steel-cased wells are present, there are several areas to be investigated. First, the significant conductivity of the steel will impact the behavior of the charges, currents, and electric fields. This is true at the electrostatic limit, relevant to DC resistivity surveys, as well as when the source fields are time-varying, as in electromagnetic (EM) surveys. When considering EM surveys, induction effects also influence the responses, and magnetic fields and fluxes become relevant, meaning that the magnetic permeability of the steel then introduces further complexity into the signals we measure. This paper is concerned with the first set of physical phenomena: understanding the physics of steel casings at DC.

Much of the initial theory and understanding of the behaviour of electric fields, currents, and charges, was developed in the context of well-logging. \cite{Kaufman1990} and \cite{Kaufman1993} provide a theoretical basis for our understanding; the first papers derives an analytical solution for a DC experiment where an electrode is positioned along the axis of an infinite length well, discusses where charges accumulate and how currents leak into the surrounding formation. From this, they show that by measuring the second derivative of the electric potential, information about the formation resistivity can be obtained. The second paper extends the analysis for finite length wells. \cite{Schenkel1990, Schenkel1991, Schenkel1994} pioneered numerical work analyzing the influence of steel-cased wells on geophysical data using an integral equation approach for solving the DC resistivity problem. They expand upon the logging-through-casing application and discuss limitations of the transmission line solution presented in \cite{Kaufman1990} for this application. They also explored the feasibility of cross-hole and borehole-to-surface surveys where one electrode is placed within or beneath a cased borehole. These examples demonstrated that the casing can improve detectability of a conductive target as compared to the scenario where no cased well is present.

With improvements in computing power, it has become possible to perform 3D numerical simulations with steel-cased wells. Simulations which capture the challenging geometry and large physical property contrasts due to well casings have have been successfully employed for DC and EM problems (e.g. \cite{Swidinsky2013, Commer2015, Hoversten2015, Tang2015, Um2015, Weiss2016, Yang2016, Heagy2018}). These advances provide the opportunity to delve further into aspects of the physics governing the behavior of fields, fluxes, and charges when casings are present in an electrical or electromagnetic survey. In this paper, we focus our attention on three aspects of DC resistivity in the presence of steel-cased well. In section \ref{sec:casing_integrity}, we examine the feasibility of conducting a DC survey from the surface to detect a flaw in the casing and discuss factors influencing detectability of a flaw. In section \ref{sec:survey_design}, we examine the use of DC resistivity for geophysical imaging when a steel-cased well is present. Finally, in section \ref{sec:approximating_wells}, we critically assess strategies for approximating a steel-cased well with a coarse-scale description to reduce computational cost.

All of the numerical simulations are run with the open source software described in \citep{Heagy2018}, which relies on the electromagnetics module within SimPEG \citep{Cockett2015, Heagy2017}. Source code for all of the simulations shown is open source, licensed under the MIT licence, and is available as Jupyter notebooks at:: https://github.com/simpeg-research/heagy-2018-dc-casing. The examples in the paper have been selected with an emphasis on examining physical principles; however, we envision that the Jupyter notebooks included with this publication could serve as useful survey design tools.

\section{DC resistivity for casing integrity}
\label{sec:casing_integrity}

Degraded or impaired wells can pose environmental and public-health hazards. A flaw in the cement or casing can provide a conduit for methane to migrate from depth into groundwater aquifers or into the atmosphere. This is particularly of concern for shale gas wells. Elevated levels of thermogenic methane, which is attributed to deep sources, in groundwater wells in Pennsylvania has been positively correlated with proximity to shale gas wells in the Marcellus and Utica \citep{Osborn2011, Jackson2013}, and failure rates of unconventional wells (e.g. shale gas wells) is estimated to be 1.57 times larger than that of a conventional well drilled in the same time-period \citep{Ingraffea2014}. Wells can fail if there is a compromise in the cement or the casing. To diagnose the integrity of a well with electrical methods, we require a contrast in electrical conductivity to be associated with the flaw, thus we will focus our attention to detecting flaws in the highly conductive casing.

Under what circumstances should we be able to detect a flaw in the casing using DC resistivity from the surface? To address this questions, we begin by examining how a gap across the diameter of the pipe changes the charge distribution and thus the resultant electric fields we measure on the surface. From there, we investigate the role of parameters including the depth of the flaw and the background conductivity on our ability to detect it from the surface. Finally, we examine the scenario in which only a portion of the circumference of the pipe is flawed.

The experiment we consider is a ``top-casing'' DC resistivity experiment where one electrode is connected to the wellbore at the surface and a return electrode is positioned some distance away. The concept and basic physics is the same as a mis-a-la-mass\'e survey in which the positive electrode is connected to a conductive target. When the source is turned on, positive charges are distributed on the interface between the conductive target and the resistive host. Electric potentials are measured on the surface and these data are then used to infer information about the extent of the conductor \citep{Telford1990}. Applying the same principles to a casing integrity experiment, we connect a positive electrode to the casing, and for an intact casing, positive charges will be distributed on the outer interface of the casing along its entire length. If corrosion causes a flaw across the diameter of the casing, the continuity of the conductive flow path for charges is interrupted, thus we get a larger charge on the top portion of the casing than we would if it was intact. This results in a larger electric field at the surface than would be observed if the casing were intact. The difference in electric field (or electric potentials) from the expected electric field that results from an intact well could then be an indicator that there is a problem with the well.

To demonstrate the principles, we start by considering a simple model of a casing in a half-space. The intact well is 1km long, has an outer diameter of 10cm, a thickness of 1cm and a conductivity of $5\times10^6$ S/m. The background is $1 \times 10^{-1}$ S/m background, and the conductivity of the inside of the well is taken to be equal to that of the background. The positive electrode is connected to the top of the casing and the return electrode is positioned 2km away. To simulate the physics, the 3D cylindrical DC code described in \cite{Heagy2018} was employed. In Figure \ref{fig:casing_integrity_basics} we show cross-sections of the (a) electrical conductivity model, (b) current density, (c) charge density, and (d) electric field for the intact well (top row)  and a flawed well (bottom row) that contains a 10m gap in the casing at 500m depth. As expected, the introduction of a resistive flaw prevents the positive charges from reaching the bottom portion of the well and thus, they are concentrated in the top portion of the well. This results in an increased current density in the top portion of the well, and similarly, an increase in the radial electric field within the top 500m.

\input{figures/casing_integrity_basics}

To quantify the charge along the length of the well, we have plotted the charge as a function of depth for the intact well (black), flawed well (blue), and also a short well of 500m length (orange) in Figure \ref{fig:casing_charge}a. In each of the wells, we observe that there is an increase in charge density near the end of the discontinuity along the length of the well. This was also noted  in \cite{Griffiths1997, Heagy2018a} and is attributed to edge-effects. At an interface between materials with two different conductivities, the normal component of the current density must be conserved, as well as the tangential component of the electric field; the discontinuity at the end of the pipe, and at the location of the flaw, means the continuity conditions must be preserved simultaneously in the radial and vertical directions, and this complicates the behaviour of the fields, fluxes and charges. Another observation is that the flawed and short wells have nearly identical charge distributions in the top 500m. In the bottom portion of the flawed well, where the remaining conductive material is, a small dipolar charge is introduced, but this is nearly an order of magnitude smaller than the charge in the top portion of the pipe. The signal due to the flaw can be defined as the difference between the total response due to a flawed well and the total response due to an intact well (the primary); we will refer to this difference as the secondary response. Figure \ref{fig:casing_charge}b quantifies the secondary charge for the flawed and short wells. We first note that the charge distributions along the short well and along the top portion of the flawed well are almost identical. This will provide the major source for a surface electric field measurement. This suggests that an inversion strategy where one attempts to estimate the length of a well may be an effective approach for characterizing the depth to a flaw.


\input{figures/casing_charge}

A 10m flaw is quite long and it is of interest to see how the results are changed if the flaws have smaller length. The distribution of charges shown in Figure \ref{fig:casing_charge} hints that the flaw may not need to be very long in order to still significantly influence the response. To confirm this, we adopt a much finer vertical discretization in order to model smaller flaws. Here, we use a shorter, 50m long well in order to reduce computational load. The flaw is positioned at 25m depth, and the length of the impairment is varied. This simulation is conducted on a cylindrically symmetric mesh, the positive electrode is connected to the casing, and a return electrode is positioned 50m away. The resultant charge distributions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:casing_charge_flawdz}. For comparison, we have again shown the charge on a well that is truncated at the location of the flaw; this is the  ``short'' well and results are displayed using the grey dash-dot line. The charge distribution is similar for all of the flawed-well scenarios, even for flaws smaller than the thickness of the casing ($10^{-2}$ m). We see similar behaviour to that shown in Figure \ref{fig:casing_charge}, where positive charge accumulates within the top portion of the well and a small dipole charge is present in the bottom portion of the well. There are minor differences in amplitude as the extent of the flaw is changed; as the extent of the flaw decreases, the amplitude of the dipolar charge on the bottom portion of the well increases slightly while the amplitude of the positive charge on the top portion of the well decreases. These distinctions, however, are small in magnitude, and even if the background is more conductive, the casing is still orders-of-magnitude larger in conductivity than any geologic material we are likely to encounter. Thus, we can conclude that, so long as the impairment affects the entire circumference of the casing, the extent of that flaw has little impact on the charge that accumulates in the top portion of the well. As such, we will proceed in our analysis using a 10m flaw in the 1km well so that a fine vertical discretization is not necessary.

\input{figures/casing_charge_flawdz}


\subsection{Survey design considerations}

When examining detectability of a signal, there are two aspects to consider: (1) the signal must be larger than the noise floor of the instrument, and (2) the signal must be a significant percentage of the primary; for the casing integrity experiment, the primary is the signal due to the intact well. Due to the cylindrical symmetry of the charge on the well, we expect the electric field at the surface to be purely radial, thus only radial electric field data need be collected at the surface. In terms of survey design, we can take advantage of the return electrode to reduce coupling with the primary.

In Figure \ref{fig:integrity_e_fields}, we have plotted the  primary field (top row), secondary field (second row) and secondary field as a percentage of the primary (third row) for four different return electrode locations. In (a), the return electrode is 2000m offset from the well, in (b) the offset is 750m, in (c) the offset is 500m, and in (d) the offset is 250m. At the furthest offset (a), there is nearly complete cylindrical symmetry in the primary field. With complete cylindrical symmetry there is no preferential direction along which to collect data. In addition to the plan view, we have plotted the primary (black line) and secondary (blue line) radial electric field along the $\theta = 90^\circ$ azimuth in the fourth row of Figure \ref{fig:integrity_e_fields}, as well as the secondary as a percentage of the primary in the fifth row.

\input{figures/integrity_e_fields}

As we move the return electrode closer, for example to 750m from the well, we notice that the secondary does not change substantially. However, if we examine the ratio of the secondary to the primary (second and fifth rows), we see that the ratio has increased. Although the primary field has similar, if not larger amplitude near the well, it also has considerable curvature. As a result, the proportion of the primary field that is in the radial direction has decreased in amplitude. Hence the important characteristic, the ratio of the secondary to primary of the radial components, has increased. The above principles are further enhanced as the return current is brought closer to the well as in panels (c) and (d), where the return electrode is brought to 500m and 250m from the well.  Again, for all of these examples the amplitude of the secondary field at the surface is quite similar. However, the choice of azimuth for the survey line will greatly affect the size of the ratio. This is something that should be considered in a field survey.

For our following examples we will place the return electrode at 500 m from the well and hence collecting radial data along a line that is perpendicular to the source line will be a good choice. We will examine several factors influencing detectability of a flaw, including the depth of the flaw and the conductivity of the background in the following sections. We will also examine the scenario where only a portion of the circumference of the well has been compromised.

\subsection{Factors influencing detectability}
\subsubsection{Depth of the flaw}
The introduction of a flaw in the well changes the distribution of charges along the length of the well, introducing a secondary dipolar charge centered about the flaw. The position of this dipole will affect our ability to detect the flaw. To examine this, we have taken the same model of a 1km pipe in a $3 \times 10^{-2}$ S/m background and varied the depth of the flaw from 300m to 900m. In Figure \ref{fig:integrity_depth}, we have plotted radial electric field results along a line perpendicular to the source electrodes; the return electrode is positioned 500m from the well. In (a), we show total radial electric field, in (b) the secondary radial electric field (with the primary being the electric field resulting from the intact well, shown in black in panel a), and in (c) we show the secondary radial electric field as a percentage of the primary. We have also indicated where values fall below a $10^{-7}$ V/m noise floor on Figure \ref{fig:integrity_depth} (a) and (b), as well as those that fall below a 20\% threshold in (c). A threshold of 20\% may be conservative, however, it does depend on knowledge of the background conductivity as well as the geometry and physical properties of the well. In many scenarios, these may not be well-constrained, thus we select a conservative threshold for this analysis. Any detectability analysis will be site-dependent and we have made all source-code available so that a similar workflow may be followed and adapted to include setting-specific parameters.

When a well is impaired, the total radial electric field is larger than that due to the baseline, intact well. The nearer this flaw is to the surface, the larger the increase and thus the larger the secondary response, and conversely, the deeper the flaw, the smaller the secondary signal. For this example of a 1000m long well in a $10^{-2}$ S/m background, a flaw at 900m depth is not detectable; there is no overlap between the region in which the secondary electric field (Figure \ref{fig:integrity_depth}b) is above the noise floor and the region in which the secondary comprises a significant percentage of the primary (Figure \ref{fig:integrity_depth}c). For a flaw at 700m depth, there is a window between 400m offset and 800m offset over which the radial electric field data are sensitive to the flaw. As the depth to the impairment decreases, both the spatial extent over which data sensitive to the flaw and the magnitude of the secondary response in those data increase.



\input{figures/integrity_depth}

\subsubsection{Background conductivity}

The total charge on the well is controlled by the contrast in conductivity between the steel-cased well and the surrounding geology. Increasing the conductivity reduces that contrast thus reducing the amount of charge on the well. The result is a decrease in the total electric field at the surface. Similarly, the strength of the secondary dipolar charge introduced with the presence of an impairment also depends upon the available charge and will also be reduced with increasing background conductivity. In Figure \ref{fig:integrity_conductivity}, we have adopted the same model of a 1km well with a 10m impairment at 500m depth, and show the radial electric field for the flawed (solid lines) and intact (dashed lines) well as the background conductivity is varied. A resistive background promotes the strongest total and secondary signals. As the conductivity increases, detectability becomes more challenging; at a conductivity of $3 \times 10^{-1}$ S/m, the flaw at 500m depth is undetectable as there is no overlap in the regions where the secondary signal is above the noise floor and where it comprises a significant percentage of the primary.


\input{figures/integrity_conductivity}

Variations in the background geology will also influence the distribution of charges and thus the measured signal at the surface. To examine the challenges introduced when variable geology is considered, we will introduce a layer into the model and vary its conductivity. The layer is 50m thick and its top is at 400m depth. The flaw will again be positioned at 500m depth, and the background conductivity is $10^{-1}$ S/m. The return electrode is 500m from the well, and radial electric field data are measured along a line perpendicular to the source. In Figure \ref{fig:integrity_layer}, we show data for a flawed well (solid) and intact well (dashed) for scenarios in which a conductive or resistive layer is positioned above the flaw. The presence of a resistive layer improves detectability, while a conductive layer reduces detectability.

\input{figures/integrity_layer}

To understand the physical phenomena governing this, we have plotted a cross section through: (a) the model, (b) the currents, (c) the charges, and (d) the electric field in Figure \ref{fig:integrity_layer_physics} for the flawed-well model including a conductive layer (top) and a resistive layer (bottom). For the comparison, there is two orders of magnitude difference between the background and the layer. When a conductive layer is present, we see that it acts to ``short-circuit'' the system as there is significant current leak-off into that layer. This reduces the amount of current that reaches the flawed section of the well and decreases the total charge on the well, which is the source of our signal. Conversely, when a resistive layer is present, there is less leak-off of currents. In fact, \cite{Yang2016} showed that rather than leaking-off, currents can enter the casing if a resistive layer is present. In terms of detecting a flaw beneath a resistive layer, this means that the current density and charge along the well increases, thus amplifying the response due to the flaw.


\input{figures/integrity_layer_physics}

\subsubsection{Conductivity of the casing}
The conductivity of the casing is also relevant to how the charges are distributed along its length. For highly conductive wells, the charge along the length of the well is approximately uniform, for more resistive wells, the charges follow an exponential decay, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:casing_charge_sigma_casing}. \cite{Schenkel1991} described the decay of currents, and thus the distribution of charges along the length of a well, in terms of the conduction length,

\input{equations/conduction_length}
Where $S_c$ is the cross-sectional conductance of the casing ($S_c = 4\pi a \Delta a \sigma_c$ for a casing with radius $a$, thickness $\Delta a$, conductivity $\sigma_c$ and has units of [S $\cdot$ m]) and $\sigma_0$ is the conductivity of the background. The casing conductance is akin to skin depth in electromagnetics and is the depth at which  the amplitude of currents have decreased by a factor of $e^{-1}$. Casing conductivities of $5 \times 10^5$ S/m, $5 \times 10^6$ S/m, and $5 \times 10^7$ S/m correspond to conduction lengths of $\sim 150$ m, $500$ m, $1500$ m. For the most resistive well shown, $5 \times 10^{5}$ S/m, the vast majority of current has decayed well before it reaches the flaw; the majority of charges are concentrated where the currents leak off, near the top of the well. Correspondingly, there is greater sensitivity to a flaw in a conductive well than in a resistive well, as is reflected in the radial electric field data shown in Figure \ref{fig:integrity_conductivity_casing}.


\input{figures/casing_charge_sigma_casing}



\input{figures/integrity_conductivity_casing}



\subsubsection{Partial flaw}
The above examples considered an impairment that affects the entire circumference of the casing. This may be suitable in some scenarios where a particular geologic unit subjects the well to corrosive conditions, however, flaws may also be vertical cracks along the well (e.g. if pipe burst occurs). This is a much more challenging problem for DC resistivity as if only a portion of the circumference is impaired, there is still a high-conductivity pathway for charges to flow along the entire length of the well. To examine the feasibility of detecting a partial flaw, we have run simulations where half of the circumference of the casing is compromised, leaving the other-half intact.

We consider four different depth extents of the flaw between 10m and 300m, in all scenarios, the top of the flaw is at 500m. In Figure \ref{fig:integrity_partial_flaw}a, we have plotted the total radial electric field resulting from an intact well (black), wells where the entire circumference is compromised (solid) and wells in which 50\% of the circumference has been compromised (dashed); (b) and (c) show the secondary radial electric field and the secondary as a percentage of the primary, respectively. We see that the depth-extent of the flaw has little impact on the fully-compromised wells, which is consistent with the observations in our previous examples. However, if the well is partially flawed, we do see variation in the secondary response. By compromising 50\% of the circumference of the well, we have reduced the effective cross-sectional conductance over that portion of the well. Numerical experiment show that if instead of introducing a flaw which comprises 50\% of the circumference of the well, we reduce the conductivity of the intact well by 50\% over the same depth extent as the flaw, similar responses at the surface result. Although for extensive flaws, there is a small region over which the secondary signal is above the noise floor, there are no regions where this coincides with measurements where the secondary comprises a significant percentage of the primary. There may be a subset of circumstances, such as if the flaw is near to the surface, or if the background geology is sufficiently well-known so that the percent threshold can be reduced, where a partial flaw may be diagnosed, however, these results demonstrate that a partial flaw is a challenging target for a DC resistivity survey.


\input{figures/integrity_partial_flaw}

\subsection{Summary}
In summary, we provided an overview of the fundamental physics governing the behaviour of charges, currents, and electric fields in a top-casing DC resistivity experiment to detect an impairment in the well. If a flaw comprises the entire circumference of some portion of the casing, then, the charges are concentrated in the portion of the well above the flaw, and to first approximation, the charge distribution is equal to that of a well which has been truncated at the depth of the flaw. This excess charge is the source of our signal. As it is cylindrically symmetric, the resultant secondary electric fields due to the flaw are purely radial. In terms of survey-design, we can take advantage of this knowledge and use the return electrode location to reduce coupling with the primary electric field in our data (as shown in Figure \ref{fig:integrity_e_fields}). Our ability to detect a flaw across the entire circumference of the casing depends upon the conductivity of the background and casing, as well as the depth of the flaw. Larger contrasts between the casing and the background (e.g. a more resistive background and / or a more conductive casing) increase the secondary response, as does decreasing the depth of the flaw. If only a portion of the circumference is impaired, leaving a conductive pathway connecting the top and bottom portions of the casing, the secondary signal is small and thus will be challenging to detect under most circumstances.

For the subset of scenarios where we do have data sensitivity to the flaw, an inversion approach to estimate the depth of the impairment might invert for a smooth background, the length of the well, and potentially the conductivity of the casing depending on if it is known a-priori.

In the next section, we transition from viewing the casing as the target to working on the scale of a geophysical imaging application in reservoir monitoring and viewing the casing as a high-conductivity feature present in that setting.

\section{Survey design considerations for imaging}
\label{sec:survey_design}

Geophysical imaging applications for hydraulic fracturing, carbon capture and storage, enhanced oil recovery, typically include steel-cased wells. The target of interest could be resistive or conductive, could be immediately adjacent to a well or offset from it, and the survey may employ electrodes on the surface or positioned down-hole. Similarly, receivers may be positioned on the surface or in adjacent boreholes; the availability of additional boreholes for recievers will be site-specific. Each of these factors influences our ability to detect a target in our data.

Detectability of a target requires two steps: (1) source fields must excite the target, and (2) receivers must be positioned so that the secondary response is measurable. In this section, we focus our attention to the first point: exciting the target, and will examine the impact of source electrode locations, the physical properties of the target and the geometry of the target on our ability to excite a response.
\subsection{Source location}
We begin by examining the impact of the source electrode location on our ability to deliver current to a region of interest in the model. The model we consider is 1km long well in a $10^{-1}$ S/m background. The well has a conductivity of $5 \times 10^6$ S/m, an outer diameter of 10cm thickness, and a 1cm thickness, as was used for the casing integrity experiment above. The conductivity of the fluid filling the casing is identical to that of the background. At this point, we wish only to contend with the positive electrode, thus we use a distant return electrode, positioned 2km from the borehole. A cylindrically symmetric mesh is used for the modelling and the return electrode is a disc of current. We are interested in effects near the well, and the return electrode is sufficiently far, so putting a 3D source anywhere at that distance yields similar results. The assumption of cylindrical symmetry and the use of a distant return electrode has similarly been applied in \cite{Schenkel1991}.

To examine the impact that the source electrode location has on our ability to excite a target, we consider the five electrode locations shown in Figure \ref{fig:electrode_location}. Three of the electrodes are connected to the casing (tophole - blue, centered - green, and downhole - red); the remaining electrodes are  not connected to the casing, including the surface electrode (orange) as well as the five electrodes near the end of the pipe (purple - within the pipe, brown, pink, grey and yellow are beneath the end of the pipe). The surface electrode is offset from the well by 0.1m radially.



\input{figures/electrode_location}

To assess the ability of each electrode configuration to excite a geologic target of interest, we will examine the current density in the formation. In Figure \ref{fig:electrode_location_currents}, we have plotted the amplitude of the current density along a vertical line (a) 25m, (b) 50m, and (c) 100m radially offset from the well. In terms of survey design, we wish to choose a source location that maximizes the total current density within the depth region of interest. If the target is near the surface, an electrode which is connected to the top of the casing, or near the casing at the surface. Interestingly, at depth, there is little distinction between these two scenarios. Thus, if one is limited to deploying electrodes at the surface, and for practical purposes, connecting infrastructure to the well-head presents a challenge, grounding the electrode near the well still results in a survey that benefits from the well acting as a high-conductivity pathway to help deliver current to depth. If the aim however, is to excite a deeper target, we see that positioning the electrode downhole can significantly increase the current density delivered to that depth. For example, if we have a target near 500m depth, positioning the electrode near that depth nearly doubles the current density as compared to an electrode at the surface. If a target is near the end of the well, between 800m and 1000m depth, then positioning an electrode near the end of the well triples the current density. This effect will be amplified if the well is lengthened, since we observe exponential decay of the currents carried along according to the conduction length (equation \ref{eq:conduction_length}).

\cite{Kaufman1990} pointed out that the difference between an electrode positioned along the axis of the casing and one coupled to the casing at depth is highly localized around the source, and thus is not an important distinction at the scales we consider for a geophysical imaging survey. We can test this numerically by comparing the currents arising from the electrode which is connected to the casing 5m above the bottom of the casing (red in Figures \ref{fig:electrode_location} and \ref{fig:electrode_location_currents}), and the electrode positioned along the axis of the casing 1.25m above the bottom of the casing (purple in Figures \ref{fig:electrode_location} and \ref{fig:electrode_location_currents}). Indeed, we see that the red and purple lines overlap for all offsets in Figure \ref{fig:electrode_location_currents}, indicating that both situations result in the same distribution of currents within the formation.

For electrodes beneath the casing, the distribution of currents is significantly different. For electrodes 1.25m, 5m, 10m and 20m below the pipe, we see that within a $\sim$ 100m above and below the electrode location, the currents are nearly symmetric, following the expected response of a point source. We have included a simulation with the electrode 20m below the pipe when there is no casing present; this is shown in black in Figure \ref{fig:electrode_location_currents}. The main difference between the distribution of currents for each of these scenarios is the reduction in current density in the top 1000m, with increasing electrode depth; as the electrode is moved deeper, less current is channeled into the casing. \cite{Schenkel1990} noted that for electrodes positioned beneath a well, if the electrode is more than 100 casing diameters beneath the casing, then the casing has little impact on the fields below or far from the pipe. The current is much more localized if the electrode is beneath the casing, and thus if a target is beneath or very near the end of the well, then it is advantageous to position the electrode beneath the well.  ?

Not surprisingly, if the source electrode can be positioned near the depth region of interest, the current density delivered to that region is larger. Numerical experiments show that the position of the return electrode makes minimal impact on the currents at depth, though if it is within 10’s of meters of the well, the near surface currents are significantly altered. This is consistent with our observations in section \ref{sec:casing_integrity}, where we showed that the return electrode location has little impact on the magnitude of the secondary signals, but can be used to alter the geometry of the source fields and reduce coupling of receivers to the primary field.

\subsection{Target properties}
The physical property contrast between the target and the background, the target’s geometry and proximity to the well all influence our ability to observe its impact in the data we measure. The purpose of this section is to explore the impact of these factors on the excitation and detection of the target. In the first example, we examine the role of the conductivity of the target which is immediately adjacent to the well. The second example is again cylindrically symmetric and examines the scenario where a disc target is co-axial with the well but there is a gap between the casing and the target. The final example is a 3D example which uses a block as a target and looks at the excitation as a function of the distance of a block from the well.

\subsubsection{Target in contact with the well}
First, we consider a cylindrical target that is in contact with the well. \cite{Schenkel1994} examined such a scenario for a conductive target (e.g. a steam injection or water flood) in a mis-a-la-mass\'e type experiment where a source electrode is connected to the casing at the same depth as the center of the target. They considered a cross-well experiment with potential electrodes in an offset, uncased well, and compared two scenarios for the source well: one in which the source well is an open-hole and the second in which it was cased. They demonstrated that the casing enhances the response, and thus the data sensitivity to the target, as compared to a mis-a-la-mass\'e experiment where current is injected directly into the target and no casing is present. In this example, we build upon those findings and examine the role of the conductivity of the target on our ability to excite it as well as the impact on the data if the target is not directly in contact with the well.

The model we use is a 1km casing in a half-space with a target. The target extends 25m vertically and has a 25m radius and the depth to its top is 900m. The model is cylindrically symmetric and thus we expect that the secondary electric field at the surface due to the target will be purely radial. As such, we apply the learnings from the casing integrity example and use the return electrode to reduce coupling with the primary field along a line perpendicular to the source. We position the return electrode 500m from the well-head and we compare both top-casing and down-hole source electrode locations.

We begin by examining the physical behavior governing the DC response of a conductive and resistive target. Figure \ref{fig:target_physics} shows the (a) conductivity model, and resultant, (b) current density, (c) charge density, and (d) electric fields for a conductive target ($10$ S/m, top row) and a resistive target ($10^{-3}$ S/m, bottom row) in a down-hole experiment where the source electrode is positioned at the center of the target. The extent of the steel-cased well is noted by the vertical black line in panel (a). For the conductive target, we see an accumulation of positive charges along the radial and vertical boundaries of the target. This is consistent with currents that have been channeled into the conductor exiting to a more resistive background. Conversely, for the resistive target, we see an accumulation of negative charge on the radial boundary, consistent with current moving from a resistive region to a more conductive material. We also notice some positive charge accumulation on the top an bottom boundaries of the target; some of the currents deflected around the resistor do enter from the top and bottom, resulting in an accumulation of positive charge.

\input{figures/target_physics}


In a DC experiment, the electric field response we measure is a result of the distribution of charges within the domain. In this example, the anomalous charge is concentrated over the depth interval containing the target. As a metric for quantifying excitation, we integrate the secondary charge over this depth interval. Table \ref{tab:target_charge} shows the In Table \ref{tab:target_charge}, we show the secondary charge integrated over the depth interval containing the target, including the secondary charge on the casing within this region. To examine how the charge relates to the electric field data, we have plotted (a) total radial electric field, (b) secondary radial electric field (with respect to a primary that includes the casing in a halfspace), and (c) the secondary radial electric field as a percentage of the primary for a down-hole source and similarly for a top-casing source (d, e, f) in Figure \ref{fig:target_electric_fields}. We have adopted the same noise floor and percent threshold as in the casing integrity examples ($10^{-7}$ V/m and $20\%$, respectively). For time-lapse surveys where a baseline survey has been taken and the background is well-characterized, this threshold could likely be reduced. The black line in panels (a) and (d) corresponds to the baseline model in which no target is present; each of the colored lines corresponds to a different target conductivity as indicated in the legend.



\input{tables/target_charge}



\input{figures/target_electric_fields}

First, we examine the impact of the conductivity of the target and notice that there is an asymmetry between secondary charge on conductive targets and resistive targets. For a 1 S/m target, which is one order of magnitude more conductive than the background, the integrated secondary charge is $1.75 \times 10^{-11}$ C, while for a $1\times10^{-2}$ S/m target, which is one order of magnitude more resistive than the background, the integrated secondary charge is $-3.82 \times 10^{-12}$ for the downhole casing experiment. There is a factor of 4.6 between the magnitude of the secondary charge on each of these targets, this is equivalent to the ratio we see between the secondary electric field measurements at the surface observed in Figure \ref{fig:target_electric_fields}b. When also considering the influence of the primary on our ability to detect a target, we see that for a down-hole casing experiment, the conductive targets are detectable, as they both have a significant region where the secondary is above the noise floor and the secondary comprises a significant percentage of the primary. The resistive targets, however, are not. Although within 200m of the well, the secondary signal is above the noise floor, this also corresponds to where the primary is large; the percent threshold would need to be reduced to less than 5\% in order to have confidence in the signals due to the resistive targets.

When comparing the downhole source to the top-casing source experiments for a fixed conductivity, there is a factor of 3.9 between the integrated secondary charge shown in \ref{tab:target_charge}, this is reflected in the secondary electric field data in Figure \ref{fig:target_electric_fields}b \& e.  For the top-casing experiment, none of the targets are detectable. There are two factors that make this a more challenging experiment than the downhole scenario: (1) less current is available to excite the target, as reflected in Table \ref{tab:target_charge} and (2) the primary field is stronger at the receivers (200m from the well the primary field has an amplitude of $10^{-5}$ V/m, while for the down-hole source experiment, the primary has an amplitude of $2 \times 10^{-6}$ V/m). The second point may be overcome if receivers can be positioned within an adjacent borehole, while addressing excitation of the target requires that the source electrode be positioned downhole, closer to the target.

In summary, the integrated secondary charge provides a metric for a survey’s ability to excite a target, and shows that conductive targets are easier to excite than resistive targets. As expected, if the source electrode can be positioned near the target, excitation is enhanced, this also has the added benefit of reducing the strength of the primary electric field at the surface, increasing the potential for detecting a target with surface-based receivers. In the next section, we examine the significance of the electrical connection between the casing and the target.

\subsubsection{Target not in contact with the well}

How significant is the electrical connection between the casing and the target for our ability to excite a response? To examine this, we introduce a small gap equal to the thickness of the casing (1cm) between the casing and the target. This has negligible effect on the volume of the target, but changes the electrical characteristics of the problem. Consider a conductive target; if it is in-contact with the well, we are effectively conducting a mis-a-la-mass\'e experiment, and the conductor will have a net positive charge. When the target is isolated from the casing, the total charge on the target must be zero, and thus dipolar effects, in which negative charges build up on the inner interface of the cylinder target and positive charges build up on the outer interface of the target, will be the source of our signal. This is demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:offset_target_physics}.

\input{figures/offset_target_physics}

The corresponding secondary charge integrated over the target depth and radial electric field data are shown in Table \ref{tab:offset_charge} Figure \ref{fig:offset_electric_fields}. For comparison, the data resulting from the target in contact with the well are plotted in the dashed, semi-transparent lines. While there is little difference in the integrated secondary charge or the electric field measurements for the resistive targets, we see that there is a factor of 1.3 difference between the integrated secondary charges and correspondingly, the secondary electric fields from a 10 S/m target in contact with the well versus not, and similarly, a factor of 1.2 between a 1 S/m target in contact with the well versus not for both the downhole and top-casing sources. Increasing the gap between the target and the casing decreases the integrated charge and thus reduces the secondary electric field at the surface. The integrated secondary charge for a 10 S/m target with a 10cm gap between the target and casing in a downhole source experiment is $1.7 \times 10^{-11}$ C, which is a factor of 2.2 smaller than the connected target; correspondingly the electric field data at the surface are reduced by a factor of 2.2 as compared to the connected target. In the next section, we further examine the impact of the separation between the target and casing.



\input{tables/offset_charge}

\input{figures/offset_electric_fields}



\subsubsection{Target offset from the well}
In some scenarios, instrumenting a well for a geophysical survey may not be possible if it is also actively being used for an injection. Accessing an observation from an other well, offset from the injection well, may then be preferable for positioning electrodes. In such circumstances, the physical property model is fully 3D and there are a few more factors that influence our ability to excite the target; in addition to the conductivity and geometry of the target, the distance between the well where the source electrode is positioned is now relevant. Again, we will examine the impact of these factors on our ability to excite and detect a target. We will break the problem into two parts, first examining excitation, then looking at how the steel-cased well can aid in detection of a target.

For a target offset from the pipe, we expect the secondary response due to that target to be dipolar. Thus, a natural proxy for excitation is the dipole moment of the target. We will adopt a Born-approximation approach to quantifying the excitation and take the norm of the integrated anomalous current density over the target volume, that is,

\input{equations/excitation}
where $\sigma_s = \sigma - \sigma_p$ is the secondary conductivity (the difference between the conductivity of the target and the conductivity of the background, $\vec{e}_p$ is the primary electric field (the electric field due to the source, casing, and half-space background), and $\vec{j}_a$ is the anomalous current density which is non-zero only over the volume where the target is located. We note that the Born approximation does not capture the distinction between a target in contact with the well versus not, and in general, will likely be an overestimate of the dipole moment of an excited target.

The target we consider is 50m wide in both horizontal dimensions and is 25m in height. Its top is at 900m depth, as in the previous examples. To quantify the excitation, we again use the Born-approximation, scattered field approach and integrate the anomalous currents over the target volume, as described in equation \ref{eq:excitation}. We will examine both downhole source and top-casing experiments. A depth slice showing the primary electric field for the downhole electrode is shown in Figure \ref{fig:primary_3D}; the return electrode is on the surface at x=-500m, y=0m. The three different target positions relative to the borehole are outlined in white. The solid line shows the target which is inline with the return electrode, the dashed is $90^\circ$ from the source electrode and the dotted line shows the target which is $180^\circ$ from the return electrode. We vary the distance from the well to the target and have plotted the Born-approximated dipole moment for four different target conductivities Figure \ref{fig:excitation_3D} for a (a) downhole experiment, and (b) a top-casing experiment. The offset is calculated from the center of the well to the nearest edge of the target that is excited by a downhole source. As before, conductive targets are much easier to excite than resistive targets, and for a given conductivity, a downhole source provides greater excitation than a top-casing source. Naturally, as the target is moved further from the well, the geometric decay of source fields reduces our ability to excite the target. Positioning the return electrode along the same azimuth as the target acts to mitigate some of these effects for targets that are at distances greater than 200m from the well, while for targets nearer to the well, the return electrode location has little effect on the excitation.


\input{figures/primary_3D}


\input{figures/excitation_3D}

The next step to consider is detection of the secondary response due to this target. Consistent with the Born-approximation approach, we simulate the target as a dipole with a moment computed with equation \ref{eq:excitation} and will compare the secondary electric field data at the surface for models with and without the casing. For this example, we select the model of a conductive target (10 S/m) with center 50m offset from the well. The target is along a line $90^\circ$ from the source (e.g. along the same line as the dashed-outline in Figure \ref{fig:primary_3D}). This gives a dipole moment of 38 Am for the target. The  electric field data, measured along this same line as the target, are shown in Figure \ref{fig:detectability_dipole}. The secondary response with the casing is shown in blue, and the response of the same dipole in a halfspace is shown in orange. The secondary response due to the dipole in a half-space falls below the $10^{-7}$ V/m noise floor for all offsets, whereas, when the casing is included, the secondary response is above the noise floor until beyond offsets of 600m from the well. The casing not only helps excite a target, as was demonstrated in \cite{Schenkel1994}, it also provides a conductive pathway for the secondary currents, thus increasing the secondary signal observed at the surface; this was similarly noted in \cite{Yang2016}. The scattering approach taken here neglects higher-order interactions between the casing and target, in order to capture those in the simulation, we wish to represent the casing and target on a 3D cartesian mesh, this is the topic of the next section.



\input{figures/detectability_dipole}

\subsubsection{Summary}
In summary, these examples showed that conductive targets are much easier to excite than resistive targets. For deep targets, a downhole electrode is preferable to a top-casing source as it delivers more current at depth to excite the target and reduces the strength of the primary at the surface, making the secondary a larger percentage of the primary. For targets in close proximity to the well, if the target is in contact, that electrical connection enhances the response. Additionally, we demonstrated that beyond helping excite a target, as was demonstrated by \cite{Schenkel1994}, the casing also improves detectability of secondary signals at the surface.

Designing a survey for a specific setting may require incorporation of 3D geologic structures and may include inversions to examine a survey’s ability to recover a target. In this case, many non-axisymmetric 3D forward models may be required, and thus it is desirable to represent the steel-cased well on a 3D cartesian mesh with cells that may be much coarser than the diameter of the casing. This is the topic of the next section.
\section{Coarse-scale approximations of the well}
\label{sec:approximating_wells}

When approaching the inverse problem, many forward simulations are required, and typically, a 3D cartesian mesh, which with cells that vary on the length scales of the geology is desired. Thus, rather than performing a fine-scale simulation of the steel-cased well, we may wish to represent the well on a coarse mesh. In the literature, two main approaches arise: the first approximates the well as some form of ``equivalent source,'' such as a charge distribution (e.g. \cite{Weiss2016}); the second approach represents the well as a conductivity feature on the coarse-mesh (e.g. \cite{Swidinsky2013, Um2015, Kohnke2017, Puzyrev2017}, among others). Here, we will focus our attention to the second approach, noting that a charge distribution along the length of the well can be computed with the 2D or 3D cylindrical code described in \cite{Heagy2018}. Within the literature, there is disagreement among approaches for selecting the conductivity of the coarse-scale feature approximating the well. \cite{Um2015} replaces the fluid-filled cylinder with a solid rod having the same conductivity as the casing, arguing that it is the contrast between the conductivity of the well and the conductivity of the surrounding geology that is the most important factor; \cite{Puzyrev2017} also adopts this approach. While several other authors have opted to preserve the cross-sectional conductance of the well \citep{Swidinsky2013, Kohnke2017}, which is consistent with the transmission-line model of the well discussed in \cite{Kaufman1990}. The aim of this section is to analyze these approaches and assess where the are valid.

We will build complexity as follows: first, we examine replacing a hollow-cased well with a solid cylinder having the same outer diameter, second, we examine approximations onto a cartesian grid, where the width of the rectangular casing is equals the diameter of the cylinder, and finally, we look at the scenario where the finest cells in the mesh are larger than diameter of the casing.

\subsection{Replacing a hollow-cased well with a solid cylinder}
We consider a steel-cased well with a conductivity of $5\times10^6$ S/m that is embedded in a 0.1 S/m halfspace; the conductivity of the material that fills the well is the same as the background. The well has an outer diameter of 10cm and a thickness of 1cm, and we will vary its length. We will perform a top-casing experiment, where the positive electrode is connected to the casing at the surface. The return electrode is positioned 8km away, and a cylindrically symmetric mesh is used in the simulations. We examine approximations that treat the casing as a solid cylinder with the same outer-diameter as the true, hollow-cased well. The distribution of charges, or equivalently, the current in the casing, is the source of the electric response of the casing. Thus to judge if two models of the casing are ``equivalent'', we examine if the current and charges as a function of depth. In Figure \ref{fig:approximating_wells_currents_charges}, we have plotted the vertical current and charges along the casing for the true, hollow cased well (solid), solid cylinder with conductivity equal to that of the casing, $5 \times 10^6$ S/m (dashed), and solid cylinder with a conductivity that preserves the product of the conductivity and the cross-sectional area of the conductor, $1.8 \times 10^6$ (dotted) for four different casing lengths, each indicated by a different color. Figure \ref{fig:approximating_wells_currents_charges}(a) shows the vertical current along the casing, (b) shows the difference in current between the approximate model and the true model, (c) shows that difference as a percentage of the true solution; the panel below shows (d) the charge per unit length, (e) difference in charge per unit length and (f) difference in charge per unit length as a percentage of the true solution.


\input{figures/approximating_wells_currents_charges}

For short wells, we see that the current decays linearly and that the charge distribution is nearly uniform away above the end of the well, while for longer wells, the decay of the current is exponential in nature, as is the charge distribution. This behavior is consistent with that predicted by the transmission line solution described in \cite{Kaufman1993}. \cite{Kaufman1993} shows that the transition between the linear decay of currents and the exponential decay of currents is controlled by three factors: the cross sectional conductance of the well, the resistivity of he surrounding formation, and the length of the well. \cite{Schenkel1991} similarly summarized this behaviour in the definition of the conduction length (equation \ref{eq:conduction_length}), which is the length over which the currents in the casing have decayed by a factor of $1/e$. For sufficiently conductive and short wells (e.g. $L_c / \delta \ll 1$, where $L_c$ is the length of the casing), the current decay is linear and independent of the conductivity, whereas for longer wells, ($L_c / \delta \gg 1$), the rate of decay of the currents is controlled by the conduction length.

In preserving the cross-sectional conductance, we see that the difference in currents and charges along the length of the well is negligible;  the maximum difference in currents for the 2000m long well which has equivalent cross-sectional conductance is $7\times10^{-7}$ A as compared to the difference of 0.18 when using the conductivity of the casing. This difference is important as it changes how much current is available to excite a target at depth. For a 2000m long well, the current is overestimated by $> 150\%$ if the well is replaced by a solid cylinder with the same conductivity of the steel-cased well. It also changes the distribution of charges and thus the electric field due to the well. Figure \ref{fig:approximating_wells_currents_charges}e show us that the extra conductance introduced when approximating the well using the conductivity equal to the casing results in a secondary dipolar charge on the casing. This in turn reduces the electric field we observe at the surface, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:approximating_wells_electric_fields}. For a long well, the difference can be as large as 40\% near the well.

\input{figures/approximating_wells_electric_fields}

The numerical time-domain EM experiment used in \cite{Um2015} to justify the approximation of the well by a solid, conductive rod having the same conductivity as the steel-cased well used a 200m long well with a thickness of 12.223mm, outer diameter of 135mm, conductivity of $10^{6}$ S/m in 0.033 S/m half-space. The conduction length of this well 560m, more than twice the length of the well, and therefore, the behavior of the currents falls into the linear regime, where the decay of currents is mostly independent of the conductivity, and thus the difference between using the conductivity of the casing or preserving cross-sectional conductance is less significant. However, if longer wells such as those typically employed in hydrocarbon settings, are considered, the behavior of the currents and charges depends upon the conductance of the casing, and thus that is the quantity that should be conserved in an approximation of the hollow-cased well by a solid rod.

In order to confirm that this conclusion is valid for variable geology, we have included a simulation with a 2km long casing in a layered background. Each layer is 50m thick and the conductivity was assigned randomly; three instances are included, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:random_layers}. The mean of the background conductivity is 0.1 S/m for each of the models.

\input{figures/random_layers}

The currents and charges along the length of the well for the true model and a model approximating the well as a solid cylinder with equal cross-sectional conductance are shown in Figure \ref{fig:approximating_wells_currents_charges_random}. For all of the models show, the difference in both the casing currents and the charges are 5 orders of magnitude less than the amplitude of the total currents and charges; thus we conclude that approximating a hollow cylindrical steel casing by a solid cylinder with a conductivity thar preserves cross-sectional conductance is valid for models with variable geology.

\input{figures/approximating_wells_currents_charges_random}

\subsection{Cartesian grid}
In the previous section, we showed that a hollow, cylindrical steel-cased well can be approximated by a solid cylinder with equal cross-sectional conductance. In this section, we move to a coarser, cartesian mesh, such as might be employed when solving a 3D inverse problem. We consider 3 different meshes, the first uses a mesh in which the finest cells are equal in width to the diameter of the casing, the second uses a 1m width for the finest cells and the third uses 10m cells. In Figure \ref{fig:approximating_wells_cartesian}, we plot the currents (top row) and charges (bottom row) within the casing as a function of depth. The panels on the left (a and d) show the total current and charges, the center panels (b and e) show the difference from the 3D cylindrical model and the panels on the right show that difference as a percentage of the primary. For each mesh, we have run two simulations, one which uses an isotropic description of the conductivity model (solid lines) and one anisotropic conductivity model (dashed lines). For the isotropic model, the conductivity of the cells containing the casing is set such that the cross-sectional conductance of the casing equals the cross-sectional conductance of the cell (e.g. for the 0.1m cell: $\sigma = 1.4 \times 10^6$ S/m, for the 1m cell: $\sigma = 1.4 \times 10^4$ S/m, and for the 10m cell: $\sigma = 1.4\times 10^2$ S/m). For the anisotropic model, we assign the vertical conductivity using the cross-sectional conductance, while for the horizontal conductivities, we use the average the products of the resistivity and cross-sectional area of the background and the casing, treating this direction more-so as a series circuit; for the 1m and 10m cells, this results in a conductivity that is equal to the background (0.1 S/m). Using 0.1m cells and an isotropic model, the error in the currents is less than 1\% at its maximum and the error in the charges is less than 0.5\% in magnitude, thus approximating a cylindrical target by a rod with a square cross section introduces minimal error. For the 0.1m cells, introducing the anisotropy as described actually increases error (nearly 4\% maximum error in the currents and $\pm 2\%$ for the charges); for 0.1m wide cells, there is a connected, conductive pathway for current to flow from one horizontal end of the cell to the other, thus treating it as isotropic is appropriate for cells that have a width that is equal to or less than the diameter of the casing. As we move to larger cells, the error in the total current and charge along the length of the well increases. For 1m cells, the error in the current is 15\% using an isotropic approximation; the error is reduced (10\%) if an anisotropic approximation is employed.

\input{figures/approximating_wells_cartesian}

Depending on the level of accuracy required in a 3D simulation, there are several strategies that one might take to reduce this error. In some cases, local refinement can be achieved with a tetrahedral mesh, as is often employed when using finite element techniques (e.g. \cite{Weiss2016}), or an OcTree mesh \cite{Haber2007}. Even with adaptive refinement, in practice, discretizing a long, steel-cased well using cells that have a width equal to the diameter of the pipe still leads to a computationally intensive problem; this is exacerbated when considering the number of simulations needed to solve an inverse problem. A primary-secondary approach, in which the primary is simulated on the 3D cylindrical mesh and interpolated to a cartesian tensor or OcTree mesh (e.g. as in \cite{Heagy2017}), may be suitable in some scenarios, such as when the target is offset from the pipe. Other, more advanced approaches including upscaling and multiscale could also be considered. In an upscaling approach, one inverts for a conductivity model that replicates the physical behavior of interest \citep{Caudillo-Mata2017}. Multiscale techniques translate conductivity information from a fine-scale mesh to a coarse-scale mesh, on which the full simulation is to be solved, using a coarse-to-fine interpolation that is found by solving Maxwell’s equations on the fine mesh locally for each coarse grid cell \citep{Haber2014, Caudillo-Mata2017a}. The merits of each approach will depend upon the geologic setting and the desired level of accuracy; what we have demonstrated here is that the 3D cylindrical code can provide a useful benchmark of the physical behaviors and an understanding of how an approximations influences them.
\section{Summary and Conclusion}
As we seek to advance our understanding of subsurface injections and improve monitoring of infrastructure, as in a casing integrity application, we must start by building a foundation based on the governing physics and an understanding of how steel-cased wells influence the behavior of the currents, fields, fluxes and charges. DC resistivity is the starting point for this exploration, as it allows us to examine the currents, charges, and electric fields in the electrostatic limit, prior to introducing inductive effects and the influence of magnetic permeability in an EM signal. In this paper, we investigated three aspects of DC resistivity in settings with steel-cased wells: (1) the feasibility of using a surface-based DC resistivity survey for diagnosing impairments along a well in a casing integrity experiment, (2) survey design considerations for exciting a conductive or resistive target at depth, and (3) strategies for approximating the fine-scale structure of a steel cased well with a coarse-scale representation to reduce computational load.

With respect to casing integrity, the concept is similar in principle to a mis-a-la-mass\'e survey, a positive electrode is connected to the top of the casing, and the continuously-connected portion of the casing is positively charged. If a flaw which comprises the entire circumference of the casing is introduced, the charges are concentrated in the top portion of the well, increasing the radial electric field at the surface. The response is similar to that of a short well that is truncated at the same depth as the flaw, suggesting that an inversion strategy could be based upon inverting for the length of a well. Prior to developing an inversion, we first require that the signal of interest be detectable, meaning that (a) the signal due to the target must be above the noise floor of the receivers and (b) the secondary signal must be an appreciable percentage of the primary field. Point (a) is controlled by the setting, including the the depth of the flaw, conductivity of the background, and conductivity on the casing. We also showed that if only a portion of the well is flawed, it is unlikely to generate a strong-enough signal to be detected. The second aspect of detectability is concerned with how the receivers couple to the primary field. Due to the cylindrical symmetry of the casing, the signal from a flaw is purely radial at the surface. Knowing this, we can take advantage of the return electrode and use it to alter the geometry of the source fields. This suggests a survey design strategy consisting of two orthogonal lines of electrodes, one for the return electrodes, the other for receivers, each starting at the wellhead and terminating at a distance beyond the length of the well.

Next, we considered an example of a subsurface injection and examined factors influencing our ability to design a DC survey capable of exciting a conductive or resistive target at depth. For a deep target, it is advantageous to position the electrode near the target-depth, as this increases the current density to this region, particularly as compared to a surface-based survey. We also showed that conductive targets are easier to excite than resistive targets and that targets in-contact with a well produce a stronger response than those that are not. Using a Born-approximation approach, we saw that beyond helping to excite a target, as has been shown by several authors, the casing also helps enhance secondary signals from deep targets at the surface.

Looking towards solving inverse problems in settings with steel-cased wells, it is advantageous to reduce the computational cost of the forward simulation, as an inversion requires many forward simulations. There are several approaches that can be taken to achieve this, one common approach is to approximate the finely-discretized well with an approximation on a coarse-scale mesh. Currently, there is disagreement within the literature as to how this should be done. Some authors have advocated that the conductivity contrast between the casing and the background should be preserved and thus replace a hollow steel-cased well with a solid rod that has a conductivity equal to that of the casing. Other authors have opted to preserve the product of the conductivity and cross-sectional area of the casing, following the conclusions of the transmission-line solution shown in \cite{Kaufman1990}. We confirmed that, indeed, the product of the conductivity of the casing and the cross sectional area is the important quantity to preserve when approximating the casing. When moving to coarser meshes it may be advantageous to represent the casing as an anisotropic conductivity structure in the model.

Source code for all of the examples has been provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks to enable exploration and ease extension of this work at https://github.com/simpeg-research/heagy-2018-dc-casing (archived on Zenodo). The software used to run these simulations has been developed as a part of the SimPEG framework. This analysis has benefited from the ease of which enables fields, fluxes and charges are readily calculated and visualized. In looking to extend this analysis to electromagnetic surveys, SimPEG contains forward modelling and inversion machinery for both time and frequency domain, easing this extension. Furthermore, the availability of flexible inversion machinery provides opportunity for development of an inversion for casing integrity applications.

Something forward looking to EM? Pipeline monitoring?
