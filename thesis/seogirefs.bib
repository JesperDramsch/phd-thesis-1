  abstract={In this paper, we apply a model-based inversion scheme for the interpretation of the crosswell electromagnetic data. In this approach, we use open and closed polygons to parameterize the unknown configuration. The parameters that define these polygons are then inverted for by minimizing the data misfit cost function. Compared with the pixel-based inversion approach, the model-based inversion uses only a few number of parameters; hence, it is more efficient. Furthermore, with sufficient sensitivity in the data, the model-based approach can provide quantitative estimates of the inverted parameters such as the conductivity. The model-based inversion also provides a convenient way to incorporate a priori information from other independent measurements such as seismic, gravity and well logs.}
