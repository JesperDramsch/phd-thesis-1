    The choice of whether to solve the EM equations in the time-domain (TDEM) or the frequency domain (FDEM) depends upon the transmitter waveform; a step-off-type waveform (left) lends itself to a solution approach in the time domain and a harmonic signal (right) is typically addressed in the frequency domain.
