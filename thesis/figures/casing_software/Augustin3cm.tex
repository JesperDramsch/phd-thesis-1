    Field strength ratio, FSR, for a receiver positioned 3 cm beneath
    the plane of the source. For comparison, we have plotted the
    FSR for the permeable pipe when the source and receiver lie in the same
    plane (L=0.00 m) with the semi-transparent orange lines.
    Note that the infinite-pipe solutions for L=0.03 m and L=0.00 m overlap.
