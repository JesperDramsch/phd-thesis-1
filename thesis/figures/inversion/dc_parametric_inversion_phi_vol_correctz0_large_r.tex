\caption{
    Parametric inversion using effective medium theory and a volume data-misfit in the statement of the inverse problem.
    The uncertainty on the volume datum was 5\%. The starting model was the same as used in Figure \ref{fig:dc_parametric_inversion_phi_correctz0_large_r}
    The inversion reached a global $\chi$-factor $<$ 0.05 after 5 iterations.
