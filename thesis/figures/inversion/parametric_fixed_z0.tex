\caption{
    Parametric inversion result where the center of the target is fixed at a depth
    of 955m. The starting model has a thickness of 10m and a radius of 10m. The initial background
    conductivity is $10^{-2}$ S/m and the initial conductivity of the target is $3\times10^{-2}$ S/m.
    The geometry of the starting model is shown by the white dashed-lines and the
    true model is shown by the solid white outline. The inversion reached a $\chi$-factor < 0.05
    and took 7 iterations.
