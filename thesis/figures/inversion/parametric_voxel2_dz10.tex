\caption{
    Parametric inversion result for a starting model
    centered at 955 m depth with a thickness of 10 m and a radius of 5 m. The initial background
    conductivity is $10^{-2}$ S/m and the initial conductivity of the target is $3\times10^{-2}$ S/m.
    The geometry of the starting model is shown by the white dashed-lines and the
    true model is shown by the solid white outline. The inversion reached a $\chi$-factor $<$ 0.05
    and took 12 iterations.
