    Representative model of a cross-well experiment aimed at detecting
    fractured volume of rock. The fractured rock volume is approximated as a sphere
    with 20m radius, conductivity $\sigma_2$, permeability $\mu_2$, that is
    positioned mid-way between the transmitter and receiver wells. The background
    is a whole-space with conductivity $\sigma_1$ and permeability $\mu_1$
