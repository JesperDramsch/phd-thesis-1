    Setup for the crosswell electromagnetic simulation. Ten fractures, each with 3 mm thickness
    and 50 m radius are spaced over a 10 m interval along the injection well. The dipole transmitter
    is positioned inside of the injection well and oriented along the x-axis. Receivers are located
    in an offset well and measure the real and imaginary parts of the x-component of the magnetic field.
