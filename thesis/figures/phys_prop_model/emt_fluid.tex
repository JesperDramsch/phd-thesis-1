    Impact of the conductivity of the fluid on the effective conductivity of a proppant-fluid mixture.
    Panel (a) shows the effective conductivity for mixtures with a $10^3$ S/m proppant and panel (b) shows the effective
    conductivity for mixtures with a $10^4$ S/m proppant. The conductivity of the fluid is indicated by the legend.
