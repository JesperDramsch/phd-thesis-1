    Impact of the conductivity of the fluid on the effective conductivity of a proppant-fluid mixture.
    Panels (a) and (c) show the effective conductivity for mixtures with a $10^3$ S/m proppant and panels
    (b) and (d) show the effective
    conductivity for mixtures with a $10^4$ S/m proppant. The conductivity of the fluid is indicated by the legend.
