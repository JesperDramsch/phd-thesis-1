\caption{
    Effective conductivity of a proppant-fluid mixure for five different proppant
    conductivities, each indicated in the legend. Panel (a) shows the conductivity on a linear
    scale, and panel (b) uses a log-scale.
    The conductivity of the fluid is 3 S/m, similar to the conductivity of sea-water.
