\caption{
    Current density for a time domain experiment over a $10^{-2}$ S/m half-space.
    The positive electrode is on the surface where the well-head will be and the return electrode is at $x=1000$ m. Each row corresponds to different time, as indicated in the plots in panel (c). Panel (a) shows a cross section through the half-space along the same line as the source-wire. Panels (b) and (c) show depth-slices of the currents at 54 m and 801 m depth.
