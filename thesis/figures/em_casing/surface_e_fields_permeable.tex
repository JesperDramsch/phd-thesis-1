\caption{
    Simulated electric field at the surface of the earth, as was presented in \ref{fig:surface_e_fields_overview}.
    The top row (a -- d) are the data simulated with the conductive casing. The second rows (e -- h) are the data
    simulated with the conductive, permeable casing. The third row (i -- l) is the difference (permeable and conductive minus conductive only),
    and the fourth row (m and n) show the difference as a percentage of the conductive solution.
